## how to push changes from local PC

so first make some changes to your file. Like just making changes or addingg a new file. Always do "git status" to check the status of your git repository. if you added a new ffile do "git add ." for all files or "git add filename" for 1 file. This will track all the files. Then do "git commit -m some message" to save the changes. Then do "git push" to push it github/online.
